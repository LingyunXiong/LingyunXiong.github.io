Launched in 2022, Dynamics Club is a UCLA-based forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Starting from 2024, this is also the home for the [Interoception Dynamics](https://bri.ucla.edu/affinity-groups/#1725383881651-5acf33f9-a12c) Affinity Group. 

Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to in-person events. Campus visits are made possible by the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology ([IBP](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu)), Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences ([QCBio](https://qcb.ucla.edu)) and Brain Research Institute ([BRI](https://bri.ucla.edu)).

Currently, we have **332** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)!

# Dynamics Club in November - SfN: 

### [**Falling asleep follows a predictable bifurcation dynamic**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41152637/)

Speaker: [**Junheng Li, PhD**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/junheng-li-8993b7166/?originalSubdomain=uk) (Postdoctoral Researcher; Imperial College London)

Date and Time: **Nov 20 (Thursday)** at <ins>3pm Pacific Time / 6pm Eastern Time</ins>

Hybrid Event: **Boyer Hall 554** and on **Zoom** (Meeting ID: 910 1626 6547; Passcode: 721030)	

Abstract:\
Sleep is a fundamental part of our lives; yet, how our brain falls asleep remains one of the most enduring mysteries of neuroscience. Here we report a new conceptual framework to analyze and model this phenomenon. The framework represents the changes in brain electroencephalogram activity during the transition into sleep as a trajectory in a normalized feature space. We use the framework to show that the brain’s wake-to-sleep transition follows bifurcation dynamics with a distinct tipping point preceded by a critical slowing down. We validate the bifurcation dynamics in two independent datasets, which include more than 1,000 human participants. Finally, we demonstrate the framework’s utility by predicting a person’s progression into sleep in real time with seconds temporal resolution and over 0.95 average accuracy.
