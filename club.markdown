Launched in Jan 2022, Dynamics Club is a UCLA-based forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Starting from Fall 2024, this is also the home for the [*Interoception Dynamics*](https://bri.ucla.edu/affinity-groups/#1725383881651-5acf33f9-a12c) Affinity Group. 

Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to in-person events. Campus visits are made possible by the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology ([IBP](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu)), Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences ([QCBio](https://qcb.ucla.edu)) and Brain Research Institute ([BRI](https://bri.ucla.edu)).

Currently, we have **310** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)!

# Interoception Dynamics in February: 

### [**State-Dependent Taste Modulation: Mechanisms of Sodium Appetite and Tolerance**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37989313/)

Date and Time: **Feb 7 (Friday)** at 11am Pacific Time / 2pm Eastern Time

Abstract:\
Taste is perceived distinctively with different internal states and hormone levels. Human studies have revealed a shifted perception of multiple tastes, during transient physiology states including hunger, thirst, satiety, and long-term states including pregnancy, malnutrition and aging. However, the body-brain-axis of hormone regulation, internal state change, and modified taste threshold remained unclear. Sodium appetite and ingestion offers an excellent platform to address this question. The hedonic value of salt fundamentally changes depending on the internal state. High concentrations of salt induce innate aversion under sated states, whereas such aversive stimuli transform into appetitive ones under sodium depletion. Using transcriptomics state-to-cell-type mapping and neural manipulations, we show that positive and negative valences of salt are controlled by anatomically distinct neural circuits in the mammalian brain. The hindbrain interoceptive circuit regulates sodium-specific appetitive drive while behavioral tolerance of aversive salts is encoded by a dedicated class of neurons in the forebrain lamina terminalis (LT) expressing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor, Ptger3. We show that these LT neurons regulate salt tolerance by selectively modulating aversive taste sensitivity partly through a PGE2-Ptger3 axis. These results reveal the bimodal regulation of appetitive and tolerance signals toward salt, which together dictate the amount of sodium consumption under different internal states.
