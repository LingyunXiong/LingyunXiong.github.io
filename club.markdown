Launched in Jan 2022, Dynamics Club is a UCLA-based forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Starting from Fall 2024, this is also the home for the [*Interoception Dynamics*](https://bri.ucla.edu/affinity-groups/#1725383881651-5acf33f9-a12c) Affinity Group. 

Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to in-person events. Campus visits are made possible by the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology ([IBP](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu)), Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences ([QCBio](https://qcb.ucla.edu)) and Brain Research Institute ([BRI](https://bri.ucla.edu)).

Currently, we have **302** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)!

# Interoception Dynamics Guest Lecture in November: 

### [**A dynamical perspective on the origin of nervous systems**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352154624000883)

Speaker: [**Dr. Ann Kennedy**](https://sites.northwestern.edu/kennedylab/) (Associate Professor; Scripps Institute)

Date and Time: **Nov 22 (Friday)** at 3:30-5pm Pacific Time 

In-person event at UCLA: **Gonda Research Center 1357**	

Abstract:\
How did the first nervous systems arise, and what was their function? While several theories on the origin of nervous systems exist, new techniques for large-scale neural recordings in diverse animals enable fresh perspective into the potential dynamics and function of early nervous systems. Building on our study of the neural dynamics of the jellyfish cousin *Clytia hemisphaerica*, we hypothesize that endogenous activity, including oscillations, was a key feature of early nervous systems. Here, we will discuss what questions can be posed about the organization and modulation of endogenous activity, and how these questions can be addressed through a combination of theory and experiment.
