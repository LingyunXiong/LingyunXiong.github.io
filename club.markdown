Launched in 2022, Dynamics Club is a UCLA-based forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Starting from 2024, this is also the home for the [Interoception Dynamics](https://bri.ucla.edu/affinity-groups/#1725383881651-5acf33f9-a12c) Affinity Group. 

Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to in-person events. Campus visits are made possible by the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology ([IBP](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu)), Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences ([QCBio](https://qcb.ucla.edu)) and Brain Research Institute ([BRI](https://bri.ucla.edu)).

Currently, we have **340** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)!

# Dynamics Club in August: 

### [**Sleep microstructure organizes memory replay**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39743590/)

Speaker: [**Wenbo Tang, PhD**](https://braincomputation.org/people/) (Postodoctal Associate; Cornell University)

Date and Time: **Aug 12 (Tuesday)** at <ins>11am Pacific Time / 2pm Eastern Time</ins>

Abstract:\
A significant challenge in both biological and artificial neural networks is preventing catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon whereby the acquisition of new knowledge can interfere with previously stored memories. We proposed that sleep comprises specific cognitive states dedicated to these functions. Inspired by human studies, we employed pupillometry to monitor brain state dynamics concurrently with electrophysiology in mice engaged in various tasks. Our results demonstrated that memory processes related to both familiar and novel experiences did not occur uniformly during sleep; rather, they fluctuated between two sub-states characterized by contracted or dilated pupils on a minute timescale. This temporal differentiation may assist in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and indicates that non-invasive, pupillometry-guided brain modulation in humans could facilitate high-resolution control of cognitive processes.
