Launched in Jan 2022, Dynamics Club is a UCLA-based forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Starting from Fall 2024, this is also the home for the [*Interoception Dynamics*](https://bri.ucla.edu/affinity-groups/#1725383881651-5acf33f9-a12c) Affinity Group. 

Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to in-person events. Campus visits are made possible by the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology ([IBP](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu)), Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences ([QCBio](https://qcb.ucla.edu)) and Brain Research Institute ([BRI](https://bri.ucla.edu)).

Currently, we have **306** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)!

# Interoception Dynamics in January: 

### [**Imaging cAMP Signaling Dynamics in the Heart: Exploring Sympathetic Responses in Real Time**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36662864/)

Speaker: [**Jessica Caldwell, PhD**](https://health.ucdavis.edu/pharmacology/postdoctoral_scholars.html) (Postdoctoral Scholar; UC Davis)

Date and Time: **Jan 22 (Wed)** at 11am Pacific Time / 2pm Eastern Time

Virtual event on Zoom (Meeting ID: 943 5316 3896; Passcode: 181904)	

Abstract:\
cAMP signaling plays a central role in how the heart responds to sympathetic stimulation, fine-tuning cellular activity to maintain function during stress. While much of our understanding comes from studies on isolated cells, my work focuses on capturing these dynamics in the intact heart, where spatial organization and tissue-level interactions are critical for normal function. Using a cutting-edge optical imaging platform and transgenic mice with a cardiac-specific FRET-based cAMP biosensor, my work reveals how cAMP dynamics vary across regions of the whole heart in real-time. This approach has uncovered striking sex-specific differences in cAMP signaling and how these variations contribute to arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. In this talk, I’ll highlight how advanced imaging offers insights into how signaling heterogeneity contributes to cardiac health and disease.
