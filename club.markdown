Launched in Jan 2022, Dynamics Club is a forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to occasional in-person visit. All are welcome! 

Currently, we have **290** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)! 

Call for 2024 speakers is still open: please fill in the [**form**](https://forms.gle/HuNdCuoJUGktCzQ9A) to indicate your preferences.

# Upcoming Events in May: 

### Guest lecture: [**What do elevated levels of albumin in urine mean?**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35178707/)

Speaker: [**Dr. Aurelie Edwards**](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/aurelie-edwards-phd/) (Research Professor; Boston University)

Date and Time: May 24 (Fri) at 10am PT / 1pm ET 

Virtual event on Zoom (Meeting ID: 927 4378 5517, Passcode: 147406)

Abstract: \
The kidneys normally filter a very small fraction of large plasma proteins, since these proteins play important roles (in transport, immune function, maintaining blood volume, etc.) and should not be excreted. The presence of significant amounts of albumin in urine signifies dysfunction, but it is difficult to interpret, since many factors – such as capillary permeability, filtration rates, shear stress, concentration, receptor kinetics – impact the renal handling of albumin. In this talk, we will describe how mathematical modeling of albumin transport in kidney tubules can provide essential insight into the mechanisms underlying urinary loss of albumin, particularly in diabetes. We will focus on how changes in plasma filtration rates and downregulation of the albumin receptors megalin and cubilin contribute to raising albumin excretion in early-stage diabetes and uni-nephrectomy, a model of living kidney donation.

### **Matching a network model of the yeast cell cycle to multiple dynamic behaviors of mutant datasets**

Speaker: [**Dr. Breschine Cummins**](https://math.montana.edu/directory/faculty/1582810/breschine-cummins) (Assistant Professor; Montana State University)

Date and Time: May 29 (Wed) at 11am PT / 2pm ET 

Hybrid event: *Boyer Hall 130* and on Zoom (Meeting ID: 915 5371 7489, Passcode: 589284)

Abstract: \
Modeling biological systems holds great promise for speeding up the rate of discovery in systems biology by predicting experimental outcomes and suggesting targeted interventions. However, this process is dogged by an identifiability issue, in which network models and their parameters are not sufficiently constrained by coarse and noisy data to ensure unique solutions. In this work, we evaluated the capability of a simplified yeast cell-cycle network model to reproduce multiple observed transcriptomic behaviors under genomic mutations. We matched time-series data from both cycling and checkpoint arrested cells to model predictions using an asynchronous multi-level Boolean approach. We showed that this single network model, despite its simplicity, is capable of exhibiting dynamical behavior similar to the datasets in most cases, and we demonstrated the drop in severity of the identifiability issue that results from matching multiple datasets.
