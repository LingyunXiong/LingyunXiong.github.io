Launched in Jan 2022, Dynamics Club is a UCLA-based forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Starting from Fall 2024, this is also the home for the [Interoception Dynamics](https://bri.ucla.edu/affinity-groups/#1725383881651-5acf33f9-a12c) Affinity Group. 

Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to in-person events. Campus visits are made possible by the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology ([IBP](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu)), Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences ([QCBio](https://qcb.ucla.edu)) and Brain Research Institute ([BRI](https://bri.ucla.edu)).

Currently, we have **315** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)!

Abstract:\
Appropriate nervous system function relies on coordinated development and integration of neurons and glia in complex networks in both the brain and periphery. However, our current understanding of these networks in the periphery is almost entirely neuron-centric with little attention given to the important contributions of glial subtypes. To address this gap, we investigated cardiac nexus glia (CNG) in the zebrafish heart, which are critical for establishing and maintaining heart rate and rhythm during development. With the use of genetically encoded calcium indicators, we observed that these glia are physiologically active and appear to have a functional relationship with cardiomyocytes. Additionally, this physiological activity evolves throughout larval development and seems to mature between 3 and 4dpf. Our data show that the CNG population expands clonally from an intermediate progenitor derived from the neural crest. Once they begin to express gfap, individual nexus glia do not divide and, using lifeact reporters, we observe that they maintain stable domains over time. Using chemical and genetic approaches to temporarily prevent cardiac contractions, we determined that even though nexus glia develop in a constantly moving tissue, the CNG population is not dependent on mechanical movement of the heart. Therefore, we explored the intrinsic genetic determinants of nexus glia by performing a large-scale screen using a custom built robot that combines microfluidics and confocal microscopy. With this approach, we identified genes that regulate CNG development, including cell surface receptors and transcriptional regulators, several of which are known to be expressed in CNS astrocytes and PNS glial subtypes. By dissecting the basic cellular mechanisms and genetic programs of nexus glia, we gained valuable insight into how organ-specialized glial populations contribute to PNS homeostasis and function and deepened our understanding of peripheral nervous system development.
