Launched in Jan 2022, Dynamics Club is a UCLA-based forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Starting from Fall 2024, this is also the home for the [Interoception Dynamics](https://bri.ucla.edu/affinity-groups/#1725383881651-5acf33f9-a12c) Affinity Group. 

Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to in-person events. Campus visits are made possible by the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology ([IBP](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu)), Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences ([QCBio](https://qcb.ucla.edu)) and Brain Research Institute ([BRI](https://bri.ucla.edu)).

Currently, we have **312** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)!

# Dynamics Club in March: 

### [**Cell signaling in “4D”: Dynamic p53 post-translational modifications regulate cell fate**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39454005/)

Speaker: [**Dan Lu**](https://www.lahavlab.com/dan-lu) (Postdoctoral Research Fellow; Harvard Medical School)

Date and Time: **March 5 (Wed)** at <ins>11am Pacific Time / 2pm Eastern Time</ins>

Hybrid event: **Boyer Hall 554** and on Zoom (Meeting ID: 959 4006 4917; Passcode: 271104)	

Abstract:\
The tumour suppressor p53 is activated by a range of cellular stresses including DNA damage, oncogenic signals, and nutrient deprivation. Upon activation, p53 transcriptionally upregulates an extensive repertoire of genes including those affecting cellular outcomes such as cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. What remains unclear however is how information regarding the nature of the upstream stress is conveyed through p53 to elicit the appropriate dynamic downstream responses. In this talk, I describe how differences in p53 temporal dynamics (protein expression patterns) and changes in combinatorial p53 post-translational modifications, collectively influence gene expression and cell fates. The interplay between alterations in dynamics and modifications may serve as broader mechanism for the temporal organization of cellular responses.
