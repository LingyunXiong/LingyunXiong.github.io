Abstract: \
Single-cell genomics technologies enable multimodal profiling of millions of cells across temporal and spatial dimensions. Experimental limitations prevent the measurement of all-encompassing cellular states in their native temporal dynamics or spatial tissue niche. Optimal transport theory has emerged as a powerful tool to overcome such constraints, enabling the recovery of the original cellular context. However, most algorithmic implementations currently available have not kept up the pace with increasing dataset complexity, so that current methods are unable to incorporate multimodal information or scale to single-cell atlases. Thus, we introduce multi-omics single-cell optimal transport (moscot), a general and scalable framework for optimal transport applications in single-cell genomics, supporting multimodality across all applications. We demonstrate moscot’s ability across a wide range of tasks in spatial transcriptomics and developmental biology. Moscot is available as an easy-to-use, open-source python package with extensive documentation at [https://moscot-tools.org](https://moscot-tools.org).
