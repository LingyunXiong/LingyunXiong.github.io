Launched in Jan 2022, Dynamics Club is a forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to occasional in-person visit. All are welcome! 

Currently, we have **277** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)! 

Call for 2024 speakers is now open: please fill in the [**form**](https://forms.gle/HuNdCuoJUGktCzQ9A) to indicate your preferences.

Abstract: \
Hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF1a triggers adipose tissue dysfunction and insulin resistance in obese patients. HIF1a closely interacts with PPARg, the master regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, but there are conflicting results regarding how this interaction controls the excessive lipid accumulation that drives adipocyte dysfunction. To directly address these conflicts, we established a differentiation system that recapitulated prior seemingly opposing observations made across different experimental settings. Using single-cell imaging and coarse-grained mathematical modeling, we show how HIF1a can both promote and repress lipid accumulation during adipogenesis. Our model predicted and our experiments confirmed that the opposing roles of HIF1a are isolated from each other by the positive-feedback-mediated upregulation of PPARg that drives adipocyte differentiation. Finally, we identify three factors: strength of the differentiation cue, timing of hypoxic perturbation, and strength of HIF1a expression changes that, when considered together, provide an explanation for many of the previous conflicting reports.
