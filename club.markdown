Launched in 2022, Dynamics Club is a UCLA-based forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Starting from 2024, this is also the home for the [Interoception Dynamics](https://bri.ucla.edu/affinity-groups/#1725383881651-5acf33f9-a12c) Affinity Group. 

Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to in-person events. Campus visits are made possible by the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology ([IBP](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu)), Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences ([QCBio](https://qcb.ucla.edu)) and Brain Research Institute ([BRI](https://bri.ucla.edu)).

Currently, we have **340** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)!

# Dynamics Club in October: 

### [**Forces that shape the embryo: Mechanical control of gastrulation dynamics**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39261736/)

Speaker: [**Dr. Paolo Caldarelli**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolo-caldarelli-b25b0b1b0/) (Caltech)

Date and Time: **October 27 (Monday)** at <ins>9am Pacific Time / 12noon Eastern Time / 5pm Central European Time</ins>

Virtual Event on **Zoom** (Meeting ID: 987 1110 7169; Passcode: 197917)	

Abstract:\
Gastrulation marks one of the most dynamic transitions in animal development, transforming a simple epithelial sheet (the epiblast) into the body plan of the embryo. How such complex organization emerges robustly from local cellular behaviors remains a central question in developmental biology. In this talk, I will discuss how mechanical feedback governs this process across species. Using the chick embryo as a model, we showed that tissue-scale forces are sufficient to self-organize the body axis—even when the embryo is bisected—demonstrating that mechanics alone can drive large-scale pattern formation. Building on these findings, I will present new results from mouse embryos imaged using multiview light-sheet microscopy, which reveal the three-dimensional coordination of epiblast morphogenesis during mammalian gastrulation. Together, these studies uncover conserved physical principles that couple tissue mechanics with fate specification during early development.
