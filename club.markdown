Launched in Jan 2022, Dynamics Club is a forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to occasional in-person visit. All are welcome! 

Currently, we have **290** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)! 

Call for 2024 speakers is still open: please fill in the [**form**](https://forms.gle/HuNdCuoJUGktCzQ9A) to indicate your preferences.

# Upcoming Events in June: 

### Guest lecture: [**Pulsed stimuli entrain p53 to synchronize single cells and modulate cell-fate determination**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37961090/)

Speaker: [**Dr. Eric Batchelor**](https://batchelorlab.umn.edu) (Assistant Professor; University of Minnesota)

Date and Time: Jun 4 (Tue) at 1pm PT / 4pm ET

In-person event: *Boyer Hall 159* (UCLA M&M Seminar)

Abstract: \
Entrainment to an external stimulus enables a synchronized oscillatory response across a population of cells, increasing coherent responses by reducing cell-to-cell heterogeneity. It is unclear whether the property of entrainability extends to systems where responses are intrinsic to the individual cell, rather than dependent on coherence across a population of cells. Using a combination of mathematical modeling, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, and single-cell tracking, we demonstrated that p53 oscillations triggered by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be entrained with a periodic damage stimulus, despite such synchrony not known to function in effective DNA damage responses. Surprisingly, p53 oscillations were experimentally entrained over a wider range of DSB frequencies than predicted by an established computational model for the system. We determined that recapitulating the increased range of entrainment frequencies required, non-intuitively, a less robust oscillator and wider steady-state valley on the energy landscape. Further, we show that p53 entrainment can lead to altered expression dynamics of downstream targets responsible for cell fate in a manner dependent on target mRNA stability. Overall, this study demonstrates that entrainment can occur in a biological oscillator despite the apparent lack of an evolutionary advantage conferred through synchronized responses and highlights the potential of externally entraining p53 dynamics to reduce cellular variability and synchronize cell-fate responses for therapeutic outcomes.

### [**Uncovering macrophage phenotype transitions using a stochastic modeling framework**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37839584/)

Speaker: [**Dr. Anna-Simone J. Frank**](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Anna-Simone.Josefine.Frank) (Postdoctoral Fellow; University of Bergen)

Date and Time: Jun 19 (Wed) at 9am PT / 12pm ET /6pm CET

Virtual event on Zoom (Meeting ID: 912 9080 5672, Passcode: 672561)

Abstract: \
Polarization is the process by which a macrophage cell commits to a phenotype based on external signal stimulation. To know how this process is affected by random fluctuations and events within a cell is of utmost importance to better understand the underlying dynamics and predict possible phenotype transitions. In this talk, I therefore present a stochastic modeling approach for the macrophage polarization process. Phenotype states are classified using the Robust Perron Cluster Analysis and transition pathways and probabilities are quantified by applying Transition Path Theory. Four bistable and one tristable phenotype configuration are identified. While bistable transitions are fast, phenotype transitions in the tristable situation have a comparatively long time duration. The approach allows for a probabilistic interpretation of macrophage phenotype transitions and biological inference on phenotype robustness.
