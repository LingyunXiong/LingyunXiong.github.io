Launched in Jan 2022, Dynamics Club is a UCLA-based forum for junior scientists to discuss nonlinear dynamics in biology and physiology. All are welcome! 

Our monthly seminars are mostly on Zoom, with hybrid access to in-person events. Campus visits are made possible by the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology ([IBP](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu)), Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biosciences ([QCBio](https://qcb.ucla.edu)) and Brain Research Institute ([BRI](https://bri.ucla.edu)).

Currently, we have **300** members. If you're new, sign up [**here**](http://eepurl.com/hSqQLD)!

Abstract:\
Proper tissue architecture is essential for maintaining normal tissue function. Its formation and upkeep rely on the orchestrated behaviors of tissue resident cells, such as stem cells and their niche. When this coordination is disrupted by oncogenic mutations, it can lead to architectural abnormalities and the development of cancer. While many genes and pathways involved in these processes have been identified, how cells dynamically act and communicate to either build or destabilize tissue remains poorly understood. My research employs intravital imaging to tackle these questions and unravel the principles of tissue regulation related to tissue regeneration and oncogenesis using the mouse hair follicle as a mammalian model system. Over the past few years, my studies have revealed that despite the molecular heterogeneity of hair follicle stem cells, individual stem cells and their progeny flexibly differentiate into various hair lineages based on the spatial cues they receive (PMID: 37419106). Additionally, the hair follicle mesenchyme undergoes dynamic architectural remodeling to enhance its structural robustness and fine-tune epithelial functions (PMID: 37419106). My latest work utilizes dynamic ERK signaling sensor to investigate how oncogenic mutations disrupt tissue architecture. This research shows that *Kras<sup>G12D</sup>*, a mutation that can lead to squamous cell carcinoma, converts ERK signal in stem cells from pulsatile to sustained, resulting in spatiotemporally specific tissue deformation (PMID: 38689013). By combining drug treatment with longitudinal imaging and time lapse analyses, I demonstrated that temporarily interrupting sustained ERK signal reverts this tissue deformation by modulating specific features of cell migration and division. This work underscores the critical role of signaling dynamics in coordinating cell behaviors to maintain normal tissue architecture.
