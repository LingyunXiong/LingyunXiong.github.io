Abstract:\
Mitochondria serve multiple key cellular functions, including energy generation, redox balance, and regulation of apoptotic cell death, thus making a major impact on healthy and diseased states. Increasingly recognized is that biological network stability/instability can play critical roles in determining health and disease. To understand the mechanisms involved in the control and regulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and to explore mitochondrial dynamics, we developed a two-compartment computational mitochondrial energetic-redox (ME-R) model  accounting for energetic, redox, and ROS metabolisms. The ME-R model was  not only  able to  simulate experimental data obtained from isolated heart mitochondria, but also to show complex oscillatory dynamics in key metabolic variables. Complex dynamics arise at the “edge” between fully functional and pathological behavior, setting the stage for chaos. Under these conditions, a mild, regular sinusoidal redox forcing perturbation triggers chaotic dynamics. At the “edge” mitochondrial chaos is exquisitely sensitive to the antioxidant capacity of matrix Mn superoxide dismutase as well as to the amplitude and frequency of the redox perturbation.  These results have potential implications both for mitochondrial signaling determining health maintenance, and pathological transformation, including abnormal cardiac rhythms. In a broader sense, our results also highlight the capabilities of computational mitochondrial models for exploring ROS dynamics, the role of compartmentation in the modulation of the redox environment, and how redox regulation participates in the control of mitochondrial function.

### Talk: [**p53 oscillations optimize DNA repair by regulating foci formation**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36368307/)

Speaker: [**Alessandra Lucchetti**](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/624447) (Graduate Student, Jensen Group; University of Copenhagen)

Date and Time: August 23 (Wed) at 9-10am PT / 6-7pm CET

Virtual event on Zoom (Meeting ID: 913 2547 7816, Passcode: 691049)

Abstract:\
Living organisms are constantly subjected to DNA damage, which necessitates efficient repair mechanisms. One notable feature of the repair response is the creation of localized compartments called foci around the damaged site. When multiple DNA breaks occur, the transcription factor p53 exhibits oscillations in its concentration within the cell nucleus. However, the impact of these dynamic oscillations on the repair process has remained unclear. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework that explains foci formation through droplet condensation and uncovers how the periodic and amplitude characteristics of p53 oscillations optimize the repair process. By preventing Ostwald ripening and facilitating the distribution of protein material in both space and time, the oscillatory behavior of p53, as predicted by our theory, is demonstrated to enhance the efficiency of DNA repair. These findings establish a connection between the dynamic signaling of p53 and the microscopic repair process, presenting a novel paradigm for understanding the interplay between complex dynamics and phase transitions in biological systems.
