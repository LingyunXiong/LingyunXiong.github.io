I'm honored to visit UC Davis Mathematics, Pharmacology and Physiology Departments on Nov 21-22! On Nov 21 (Monday) at 4pm Pacific Time, I will give a talk at the [**Math Bio Seminar**](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/research/seminars?talk_id=6639) to share my recent paper titled 'A common pathway to cancer: Oncogenic mutations abolish p53 oscillations'! I thank [**Dr. Timothy Lewis**](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/people/general-profile?fac_id=tjlewis) for hosting. Looking forward to catching up with colleagues in Davis and Merced!

This event will be hybrid. Join us in person (2112 Mathematical Sciences Building, UC Davis) or on Zoom!
