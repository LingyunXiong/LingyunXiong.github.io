Yesterday, I presented my latest research on *Functional coupling of metabolic oscillations and hemodynamics in the kidney* at the **APS March Meeting 2025 in Anaheim, CA**, as part of the DBIO Focus Session on "[Do details matter in living matter? Frontiers in single cell oscillations](https://summit.aps.org/events/MAR-L65/8)", which was organized by Dr. Min Wu (Yale University) and Dr. William Bement (University of Wisconsin-Madison). 

In recognition of my ongoing work on biological oscillations and continuous leadership of the [Dynamics Club](https://lingyunxiong.github.io/DynamicsClub/), I was awarded the *Devreotes Prize*, named after Dr. Peter Devreotes (Johns Hopkins University) and sponsored by the [Biochemical Society](https://www.biochemistry.org). What an honor! 

Next month, I will give another talk at the [**American Physiology Summit 2025 in Baltimore, MD**](https://www.physiology.org/professional-development/meetings-events/american-physiology-summit?SSO=Y), as part of the special session on "Defining Cell States at the Single-cell Resolution". Join us if you will be there too! 

In June, I will have the opportunity to share this work with the broader UCSD community through the Department of Bioengineering Seminar Series.
