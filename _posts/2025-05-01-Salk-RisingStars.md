I'm thrilled to join fellow postdocs across the nation to share my ongoing research on *male-female dynamic differences in the kidney* at the [**Salk Institute Rising Stars Symposium**](https://www.salk.edu/about/our-community/research-and-training-opportunities/rising-stars-symposium/) on May 13-14, 2025. 

I can't wait to connect with scientists at Salk and UCSD to discuss how this work can bear a broader impact on renal health!
