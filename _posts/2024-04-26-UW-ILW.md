This week, I had the pleasure to be among nine brilliant postdoctoral fellows in Seattle for the [**UW ISCRM Inclusive Leadership Workshop**](https://iscrm.uw.edu/inclusive-leadership-workshop/). We had the opportunity to present our current work, share our vision for future development, and connect with UW faculties for scientific collaboration and career advice. As part of the workshop, we also partcipated in the DEI initiative to learn how to create an inclusive research environment, as well as in the Future Faculty Fellowship Program to demystify the process of searching/hiring for a faculty position in academia.

It has been a fruitful week for me, meeting with a number of scientists working on stem cell biology and physiology. Especially, I'm very grateful to have visited the UW [Diabetes Institute](https://uwmdi.org) and [Kidney Research Institute](https://kri.washington.edu). I'm hopeful that I would be able to work with many kidney researchers at UW in the near future.

After the workshop, I had the chance to tour nearby mountain areas. Despite the rain, I had a glimpse into the natural beauty of the Washington State.
