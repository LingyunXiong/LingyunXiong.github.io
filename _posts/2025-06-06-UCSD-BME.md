I'm delighted to be invited for a seminar at [**UCSD Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering**](https://be.ucsd.edu). 

Today, I had the chance to talk about [**Bifurcation theory in physiology**](https://be.ucsd.edu/seminar/2025/bifurcation-theory-physiology) <ins>at 2pm in The FUNG Auditorium</ins>! Such a pleasure to be back on campus, to meet with students and faculty members at BME, where I was an exchange student exactly 10 years ago. Let there be light and we're tritons together!
