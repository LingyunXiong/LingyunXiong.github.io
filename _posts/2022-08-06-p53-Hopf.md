I'm so pleased to announce that my latest paper on p53 oscillations is finally out! As an extension to my thesis work on *Influence of inherited genetic variants on risk, biology and prognosis of common cancers*, I investigated the intriguing interaction patterns of diverse oncogenic alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, using Hopf bifurcation analysis. These diverse genetic alterations, which were related to cancer mainly through correlation or experimental manipulation, can now be understood mechanistically: they promote cancer by abolishing the oscillatory competence of p53, a property that is essential for tumor suppression. 

By applying bifurcation theory to cancer, we can now evaluate mathematically how the inherited genome influences the somatic cancer genome, and discover what a variety of oncogenic alterations have in common.
