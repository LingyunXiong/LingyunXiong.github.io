Hooray, it's my third year attending the [**American Physiology Summit**](https://www.physiology.org/professional-development/meetings-events/american-physiology-summit?SSO=Y)! 

This year, I shared my ongoing research on *male-female dynamic differences in the kidney* in the special session hosted by Jonathan Nelson, titled [**"Defining Cell States a the Single Cell Resolution"**](https://events.rdmobile.com/Sessions/Details/2629128). I'm thrilled to join the panel of Paul Welling, Sanjay Jain, Kory Lavine among others to discuss how we shall approach cell states characterization in the omics era. It was quite a day to meet Ruisheng Liu and Daniel Yip too, whose work has been the inspiration for my kidney research. Excellent dialogues and lots of encouraging words! 

Besides selected talks, I also had five minutes to promote my work at the **Sex and Gender Research Showcase** organized by Anna Stanhewicz, who pooled abstracts across disciplines to highlight research examining the role of sex chromosomes and gonadal hormones on organ physiology. Thank Mark Parker and Christopher Wilcox for raising insightful questions afterwards!
