The [American Physiology Summit 2024](https://www.physiology.org/professional-development/meetings-events/american-physiology-summit/summit-at-a-glance?SSO=Y) took place at the Long Beach Convention Center during Apr 4-7, gathering over 3000 scientists from 5 continents. It was worth mentioning that I was selected for the *APS Renal Section Research Recognition Award*, which brought me to the spotlight during the renal banquet on Apr 6 (Sat), 2024.

I had the pleasure to present a poster and host two foundational science sessions:

- Workshop on [**Quantitative Analysis of Circadian and Ultradian Rhythms**](https://www.physiology.org/professional-development/meetings-events/american-physiology-summit/program?SSO=Y#Saturday) \
Co-hosting with Eder Zavala (University of Birmingham, UK), we invited Sonia Cortassa (NIH/NIA) and Benjamin Smarr (University of California, San Diego) to showcase how to effectively process and present rhythmic data obtained from model organisms and human population. Towards the end, I had the honor to wrap up the workshop by asking the question "Are physiological oscillations *physiological*?", which stirred some interesting discussion during and after the workshop.

- Panel discussion on [**Mitochondrial Dynamics at the Crossroads of Health and Disease**](https://www.physiology.org/professional-development/meetings-events/american-physiology-summit/program?SSO=Y#Sunday) \
Together with Tanecia Mitchell (University of Alabama at Birmingham), we called for a panel of experts in mitochondrial dynamics to discuss how mitochondrial functionalities are essential to the physiology of cells, tissues and organisms. The session was received very well, even if it started at 8am on a Sunday. Numerous questions were brought forward and heated discussion continued after the session was concluded.
