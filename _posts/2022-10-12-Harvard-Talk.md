On October 18 (Tuesday) at 11am Eastern Time, I will give a talk at [**Harvard Medical School - Blavatnik Institute for Systems Biology**](https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu). I will join the collaborative group meeting for the [**Gunawardena Lab**](https://vcp.med.harvard.edu) and [**Lahav Lab**](https://www.lahavlab.com) to share my recent paper titled 'A common pathway to cancer: Oncogenic mutations abolish p53 oscillations'! I very much thank Drs. [**Jeremy Gunawardena**](https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu/jeremy-gunawardena) and [**Joseph Nasser**](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/200753) for the invitation. 

This event will be hybrid. Join us in person (200 Longwood Ave, Boston MA) or on Zoom!
