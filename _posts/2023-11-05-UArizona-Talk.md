I will give a guest lecture to the class of [**Math 119A**](https://math119a.math.arizona.edu): "Mathematics of Biological Systems: a Calculus-Based Approach" on November 27, 2023 (Monday) at the University of Arizona, hosted by Samantha Kaos. I will also visit the Departments of Mathematics and Physiology. It will be a wonderful time to (re-)connect with colleagues and friends on campus.
