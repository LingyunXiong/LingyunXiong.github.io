Today, I had great fun sharing my bioimaging journey in the [**BINA Scientific Speaker Series**](https://www.bioimagingnorthamerica.org/activities/), sharing the hour with [**Mariana De Niz**](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/cdb/faculty/profile.html?xid=57999) from Northwestern University. 

Both speakers received BINA support to attend the 17th LFD Workshop in Advanced Fluorescence Imaging and Dynamics (2023) at the University of California, Irvine, which was organized and led by [**Michelle Digman**](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/digmanlab/). The joint presentation focused on speakers' research program, how their attendance at the LFD course impacted their work, and the importance of BINA in promoting career development and global access to infrastructure and expertise.
