I had great fun attending the 67th Biophysical Society Annual Meeting, held at the San Diego Convention Center for Feb 18-22, 2023. I learned that there were about 5000 people attending the annual meeting this year. Although participation is yet to recover from COVID, it is absolutely the biggest academic event I have been to so far! 

Especially, I has the pleasure joining the guest blogger team for the meeting, as I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ivy_lxiong) away the memorable moments throughout this international conference on all aspects of biophysical research. I wrote three short pieces (listed below), summarizing interesting conversations I have had during the meeting. Check out the official [**BPS Blog**](https://www.biophysics.org/blog/category/annual-meeting-2023) for a range of topics! 

- [Calling homeodynamics for health and disease](https://www.biophysics.org/blog/calling-homeodynamics-for-health-and-disease) \
I interviewed Drs. Sonia Cortassa and Miguel A. Aon from NIH about the next revolution in biological thinking: *homeodynamics* for the 21st-century physiology.

- [Latest about sexual dimorphisms in physiology](https://www.biophysics.org/blog/latest-about-sexual-dimorphisms-in-physiology) \
At BPS2023, I learned how female scientists are leading the way in studying sex differences in physiology and how inclusion of more women in clinical trials would improve womenâ€™s health. 

- [Collection on biological oscillators at BPS2023](https://www.biophysics.org/blog/collection-on-biological-oscillators-at-bps2023) \
Among the many studies on oscillatory phenomena presented at BPS2023, the work by Dr. Min Wu from Yale Medicine exemplifies how dynamical systems theory is crucial for understanding rhythms, patterns, and complexity in biology.
