On Mar 20 (Monday) at 4pm Pacific Time, I will give a talk at the **Claremont Center for the Mathematical Sciences** as part of the [**Applied Math Seminar**](https://colleges.claremont.edu/ccms/event/applied-math-seminar-ivy-xiong-usc/). This will be a hybrid event. Join us in person (Shanahan 2407, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont, CA) or on Zoom! I very much thank [**Dr. Heather Zinn-Brooks**](https://math.hmc.edu/hzinnbrooks/) for the invitation. 

**Title**: A common pathway to cancer: oncogenic mutations abolish p53 oscillations

**Abstract**: \
The tumor suppressor p53 oscillates in response to DNA double-strand breaks, a behavior that has been suggested to be essential to its anti-cancer function. Nearly all human cancers have genetic alterations in the p53 pathway; a number of these alterations have been shown to be oncogenic by experiment. These alterations include somatic mutations and copy number variations as well as germline polymorphisms. Intriguingly, they exhibit a mixed pattern of interactions in tumors, such as co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and paradoxically, mutual antagonism. Using a differential equation model of p53-Mdm2 dynamics, I employ Hopf bifurcation analysis to show that these alterations have a common mode of action, to abolish the oscillatory competence of p53, thereby impairing its tumor suppressive function. In this analysis, diverse genetic alterations, widely associated with human cancers clinically, have a unified mechanistic explanation of their role in oncogenesis. In this talk, I will also discuss the role of physiological oscillations in health and disease broadly.
