Today, I learned that my article ["Are physiological oscillations *physiological*?"](https://lingyunxiong.github.io/2023/08/25/Yoscillate.html) published in *The Journal of Physiology* has ranked within the top 10% of most-viewed papers published by the journal in 2023 (up to 12 months after publication). 

Thank everyone for your interest in this work and stay tuned for my recent development on spontaneous oscillations in the kidney! For more discussion, check out our [**Dynamics Club**](https://lingyunxiong.github.io/DynamicsClub/) seminar series.
