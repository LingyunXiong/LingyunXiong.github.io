On October 12 (Wednesday) at 9am Pacific Time/12pm Eastern Time, I will join the [**Department of Mathematics at Brandeis University**](https://www.brandeis.edu/mathematics/index.html) to give a talk at their [**Mathematical Biology Seminar**](https://blogs.brandeis.edu/mathbio/). I will share my recent paper titled 'A common pathway to cancer: Oncogenic mutations abolish p53 oscillations'! Many thanks to the labs of Drs. [**Thomas Fai**](https://sites.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/tfai/) and [**Johnathan Touboul**](https://blogs.brandeis.edu/mathneuro/team/jonathan/) for the invitation. 

Everyone is welcome. Join us on [Zoom](https://brandeis.zoom.us/j/92054918213)!

**Abstract**: \
The tumor suppressor p53 oscillates in response to DNA double-strand breaks, a behavior that has been suggested to be essential to its anti-cancer function. Nearly all human cancers have genetic alterations in the p53 pathway; a number of these alterations have been shown to be oncogenic by experiment. These alterations include somatic mutations and copy number variations as well as germline polymorphisms. Intriguingly, they exhibit a mixed pattern of interactions in tumors, such as co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and paradoxically, mutual antagonism. Using a differential equation model of p53-Mdm2 dynamics, I employ Hopf bifurcation analysis to show that these alterations have a common mode of action, to abolish the oscillatory competence of p53, thereby impairing its tumor suppressive function. In this analysis, diverse genetic alterations, widely associated with human cancers clinically, have a unified mechanistic explanation of their role in oncogenesis. In this talk, I will also discuss the role of physiological oscillations in health and disease broadly.
