# Debutting my personal website
Post date: Jan 26, 2021

Welcome to the personal website of Lingyun (Ivy) Xiong! 

I am an early-career researcher dedicated to merge molecular biology, genomics and biomathematics to understand the fundamental principles of cancer biology. For more details, please check out my [Research](https://lingyunxiong.github.io/Research/) page.

Launched today, this site will be the primary flatform to showcase my latest research outputs. While some pages are still being polished, I am open for initial discussion and networking. 

Thanks for visiting!
