I'm delighted to announce that I have been selected for the [**Boyer/Parvin Postdoctoral Award**](https://www.mbi.ucla.edu/awards/postdoctoral-history)! 

Given out by the UCLA Molecular Biology Institute ([MBI](https://www.mbi.ucla.edu)) annually, this award recognizes outstanding postdoctoral researchers and celebrates the legacy of Paul Boyer, known for his work on ATP synthase ([Nobel Prize, 1997](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1997/summary/); with John Walker and Jens Skou).

The award ceremony was held on <ins>Wednesday, May 28 at 10am</ins> in Boyer Hall 159, during which I gave a short talk about my ongoing research on *male-female dynamic differences in the kidney*.

Below is a snapshot during the award ceremony:
