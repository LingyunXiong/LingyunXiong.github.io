I'm so pleased to announce that my latest paper on p53 oscillations is finally out! As an enxtension to my thesis work on *Influence of inherited genetic variants on risk, biology and prognosis of common cancers*, I investigated the intriguing interation patterns of diverse oncogenic alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway via Hopf bifurcation analysis. I found out these alterations all abolish p53 oscillations, a property that is essential for tumor suppression. 

By applying bifurcation theory to cancer, we can now evaluate how the inherited genome influences the somatic cancer genome mathematically, and find out what a variety of oncogenic alterations have in common.
