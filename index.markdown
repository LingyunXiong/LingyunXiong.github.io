## **Homeodynamics in Health and Disease**

I aim to understand the mechanisms and functions of oscillatory behaviors in systems physiology. Oscillatory processes permeate every branch of biology, from circadian rhythms at the molecular level, cell motility at the cellular and tissue level, hormonal regulation across organ systems, to circadian coor-dination of physical activities at the organismal level. However, how oscillatory signals impact organ functions is poorly understood1. My current research addresses this gap by focusing on physiological oscillations in the mammalian kidney. I take a multi-scale approach to investigate how tubular fluid flow and cellular metabolic dynamics are coupled to facilitate normal physiology in the kidney, how oscil-latory flow in 1 million renal tubules synchronizes to achieve organ-level coordination, and more broadly how oscillations can organize multi-organ crosstalk. Combining quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling, my onging research evaluates the mathematical structures underlying the transition from health to disease. 

## **Current Research Focus**
- Mathematical modeling of kidney functions
- Physiological dynamics via *in vivo* imaging 
- Comparative studies of organismal physiology
- Dynamical and network modeling of cell fate transition

* D.Phil. in Systems Biology, University of Oxford (2021)
* B.Sc. in Biochemistry, University of Hong Kong (2016) 
* Study abroad in Biology, University of California, San Diego (2015)
