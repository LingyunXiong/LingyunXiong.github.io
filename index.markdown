## **My research in brief**

*Q: What are the fundamental principles of cancer biology?* 

To address this question, I am taking a trans-disciplinary approach to mechanistically explain key processes that cause cancer. By integrating existing knowlege in Molecular Biology, Genomics and Biomathematics, my research aims to establish theoretical and analytic frameworks that would shed light into the essence of oncogenesis and/or tumor progression. 

Currently, I am training in mathematical oncology, with a special interest in nonlinear dynamics.


## **Ongoing research topics**
- Evaluating the role of inherited genetic variants on risk, anti-tumor immune response and prognosis in colorectal cancer.
- Influence of the inherited genome on somatic driver events in the p53 and RAS-MAPK pathways during oncogenesis. 
- Towards a unified mechanistic explanation of genetic alterations in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway in human cancers. 
- Network and dynamical modeling of mammalian transcriptome during cell fate transition. 
- Coordination of biological oscillators in mammalian systems.


## **Qualifications** 
* DPhil in Systems Biology, University of Oxford (2021)
* BSc in Biochemistry, University of Hong Kong (2016) 
* Study abroad in Biology, University of California San Diego (2015)
