## **My research in brief**

Extensive studies have establsihed that transcription factors (TFs) play an essential in fostering physiological phenotypes. However, how TFs regulate target gene expression that underlie biological phenomena is not well understood, especially when considering diverse biophysical interactions between TFs and their regulators that form complex feedback loops as well as in the context of the entire intracellular signaling network. My interest is to understand the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation that govern cell fate transition, both during normal development and between health and disease. By applying techniques from nonlinear dynamics, computational biology and advanced imaging, my research strives to explain the spatiotemporal nature of biological phenomena.

Currently, I am studying sex differences in the mammalian kidney, with Drs. [**Andrew McMahon**](https://mcmahonlab.usc.edu/) and [**Adam MacLean**](https://macleanlab.usc.edu/).
